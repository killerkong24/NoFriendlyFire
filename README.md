### NoFriendlyFire

Prevents you from hitting your own team

/friendadd <their username> adds a username to the "no hit list"
/friendremove <their username> removes a username to the "no hit list"
/friendlist shows all your current friends

keep in mind that some servers my not allow this mod aswell as grim anticheat sends failed simulation messages (because it messes with sending packets)
